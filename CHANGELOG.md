* Resolving some scoring issues on pub.dev
* Added minimal API documentation and fixed static analysis problems

## [0.1.0-dev.1] - 01/20/2021

* Initial release
* Package working as one might expect
* Before releasing as a 1.0.0 stable version I want to add all of the things the built-in widgets support that us "amateur" devs do not include; there is a lot of work to bring it up to par with official widgets
