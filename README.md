# ThemeModeSelector Widget

I am currently working with the concept of Theme's in Flutter and I wanted to build a widget which would allow me to switch between light and dark themes. Seeking a design for a simple toggle, I was lucky enough to stumble into some of [Zhenya Karapetyan's](https://dribbble.com/jenkarapetyan) amazing work on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). Zhenya's simple yet fun design of a toggle component would look very nice in Flutter, and it has some really cool animations which I wanted to learn.
